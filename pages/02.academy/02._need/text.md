## Need

Accounting for around 40% of GHG emissions from building operations and an additional 10-20% from embodied emissions, the construction sector is one of the major contributors to the climate crisis, making it a priority target for the green transformation.

The urgency of the climate crisis requires accelerating the transfer and adoption of climate change mitigation knowledge and capabilities to workers, businesses, policy makers, and the public.

The need for skilled workers and educated professionals is a significant bottleneck for rethinking the built environment and the construction ecosystem and transform it towards a regenerative model.
