## Main expected impacts

The NEB Academy will make a significant contribution to the European Commissionâ€™s target of training 3 million workers in 5 years by 2030. The business model for bringing more hubs into the Alliance and growing the community of practice will ensure more workers are trained, and companies are ready to invest into up-/re-skilling. The up- and re-skilled workforce will enhance stability, resilience and competitiveness to SMEs and mid-caps attempting to gain market entrance if a highly competitive sector.
