## Mission 

The [New European Bauhaus Academy](https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/about/neb-academy_en) (NEBA), a flagship initiative of the European Commission on skills for sustainable construction, accelerates the up- and re-skilling of the current and future workforce to transition to a resilient domestic building construction sector.

> **_“NEB Academy’s mission is to train, upskill, and reskill the construction ecosystem to achieve a carbon neutral building sector and a beautiful, sustainable, and inclusive transformation of the built environment.”_**

The main goal is to unlock the decisive potential of the decarbonisation of the built environment by a major transformation. The ambition is to establish NEBA as the European point of reference for skills and knowledge on bio-based, circular and digital solutions in construction.
