## Training
Offering training via a digital platform and applying innovative pedagogies will be useful in attracting young talent and professionals from other disciplines to the construction sector. The availability of digital training materials will help ensure learners and trainers in both cities and rural areas across EU regions have access to the same high-quality materials.

Trust in the training contents and their quality will be ensured through NEBA Alliance certification. NEBA will set a new benchmark for the quality and availability of training raising the bar for other training providers. The long-term and sustainable NEBA model for providing training can be extended to and replicated in other domains.

Over time, the up- and re-skilling of workers will accelerate the decarbonisation of the built environment and reduce GHG emissions from buildings.
