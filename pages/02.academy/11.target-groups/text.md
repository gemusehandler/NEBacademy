## Training
Offering training via a digital platform and applying innovative pedagogies will be useful in attracting young talent and professionals from other disciplines to the construction sector. The availability of digital training materials will help ensure learners and trainers in both cities and rural areas across EU regions have access to the same high-quality materials.

Trust in the training contents and their quality will be ensured through NEBA Alliance certification. NEBA will set a new benchmark for the quality and availability of training raising the bar for other training providers. The long-term and sustainable NEBA model for providing training can be extended to and replicated in other domains.

Over time, the up- and re-skilling of workers will accelerate the decarbonisation of the built environment and reduce GHG emissions from buildings.


## Target groups
**TG1 - Education, training and academia**

TG1 is the main target group of institutions that can become members/partners and contributors of the NEBA. Based on the ‘train-the-trainers’ approach, they will be direct users of NEBA training courses and materials, and they will thus reach the other TGs 2, 3 & 4 within their national and regional setting. Contents are co-created to suit specific needs of their users.

* 1.1 Higher education and universities
* 1.2 VET centres and professional schools
* 1.3 Other training providers, e.g., specialised companies, associations, networks, clusters, living labs, makers spaces, technological hubs.

**TG2 – Construction ecosystem, private sector**

TG2 comprises the main beneficiaries of the NEBA trainings, notably workers and employees in SMEs and mid-caps, and other professionals in the construction ecosystem. It includes several diverse subgroups, which each will be addressed specifically. The training materials used require targeted contents and suitable formats in respect to educational levels and goals, notably to transfer usable skills and knowledge on biobased, digital and circular solutions.

* 2.1 Construction industries and contractors
* 2.2 Developers and investors
* 2.3 Architects, engineers, and designers
* 2.4 Biobased/bioeconomy industries
* 2.5 Creative and Cultural heritage sector
* 2.6 Industry associations and federations
* 2.7 Financial sector, investors
* 2.8 Others: Suppliers, related industries

**TG3 - Public bodies and policy makers**

TG3 includes decision makers and supporting organisations that create the enabling environment for the transition of the built environment. They require specific training formats with less ‘practical’ content and technical detail, but relevant information for decision processes about benefits and advantages of biobased, digital and sustainability solutions.

* 3.1 Public decision-makers and planners, regions, and cities
* 3.2 Legislators, national/ regional ministries, and governments
* 3.3 Standardisation bodies
* 3.4 Funding organisations

**TG4 - General public and civil society**

TG4 engages all citizens and end-users who are affected by products and systems in the built environment. Contents require to raise awareness for biobased solutions affecting wellbeing, health, sustainable environment, nature, beauty/aesthetics, affordability, inclusiveness, social impacts.

* 4.1. Citizens and representative bodies, such as end-users, customers, NGOs
* 4.2 Media
