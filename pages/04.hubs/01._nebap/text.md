## NEBA establishes Hubs with regional coverage and/or expertise in specific topics. These Hubs create joint business plans and operational models, which are then connected through a digital platform. This platform serves as a matchmaker between learners and trainers, as well as an open directory and repository for NEBA-certified training content. The training content addresses bio-based, circular, regenerative, and long-life processes, concepts, and solutions. Participants are rewarded with microcredentials.**
