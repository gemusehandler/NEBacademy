## Course Syllabus

**Module 1 - Why use timber for sustainable building?**

We will explore the importance of shifting to a (more) timber and bio-based construction industry, within the larger societal context of circularity, sustainability and the move toward a ‘post-carbon’ building sector. You will learn how this includes the entire value chain from sustainable forestry to the socio-cultural and economic aspects of policies that hinder, or favor, timber construction and innovation.

**Module 2 - Environmental impacts of building with timber **

We will explain the relevance of assessing the environmental impacts of building with timber vs. conventional materials, with a method called Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). You will learn the general framework of LCA, and compare results based on an illustrative case study assessing alternative materials. We will then focus on the comparison of carbon footprints, end-of-life scenarios, and the importance of prolonging product lifespans.

**Module 3 - Basics & Principles in Timber Construction **

You will embark on a journey through the evolution of timber construction, starting with the history of timber products, from traditional sawn timber to modern CNC-milling. We will delve into the basic properties of wood, its structural capacity, fire safety and seismic resistance, and its impact on acoustics and well-being.

**Module 4 - Multi-Storey Timber Buildings**

Journey through the intricacies of timber structures and components, traversing from basic log construction to advanced space module methodologies. We will define building heights and explore the diverse timber building typologies ranging from low-rise, mid-rise, refurbishments and topping-ups, to the ambitious high-rise and tall timber constructions. Concluding the module, you will encounter hybrid timber systems: both those combining varied wood species into harmonious structures and the innovative composite concrete floor systems setting the standard for multi-storey edifices.

**Module 5 - Advanced topics and future trends**

You will delve into the historical evolution of joinery culture and the crucial role it plays in timber construction. You will explore timber façades and discover the products that shape their beauty. Water management strategies, the anatomy of skins and the thermal envelope will become your ally as you understand its impact on timber façades. Prefabrication of components and assembly with elements will unlock new possibilities for efficient construction, adaptability and values for change. And as we look to the future of timber construction, you will be inspired by innovations yet to come. 

**Module 6 - Prefabrication and building process benefits**

We will explore the prefabrication potential of building in mass timber. You will go on a short (virtual) tour through a conditioned manufacturing hall to understand how activities associated with construction can easily be moved away from building sites, and why they should be.
