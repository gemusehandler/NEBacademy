**European Wood Policy Platform (WoodPoP)**<br />
Multilateral, pan-European innovative policy dialogue on sustainable wood and circular bioeconomy. Initiative liaising with 27 member states, chaired by the International Union of Forest Research (IUFRO), based in Vienna/Austria.

Main outcomes and synergies with NEBA: WoodPop has set up five Technical Working Groups (TWG), which develop joint activities, recommendations and policy solutions on specific matters. Participation is open to representatives from public and private sector, interest groups, research organizations and networks, government officials and invited experts. Of special relevance for NEBA are TWG3 ‘Innovation and Research’ and TWG4 ‘Education and Vocational Training’, which is chaired by InnoRenew CoE.
