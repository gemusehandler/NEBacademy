# NEB ACADEMY
**Concrete, brick, cement, and steel are the most commonly used building materials in Europe. However, the production of these materials releases vast amounts of CO2. Building with wood presents a perfect alternative, as it captures CO2 instead of emitting it.**

**But switching from brick to bio-based materials is easier said than done. Architects, builders, and construction workers need to learn new skills, adopt new techniques, and change their building practice. The New European Bauhaus Academy (NEB Academy) is here to help.**

**NEB Academyâ€™s mission is to train, upskill, and reskill the construction ecosystem to achieve a carbon-neutral, beautiful, sustainable, and inclusive transformation of the building sector.**
